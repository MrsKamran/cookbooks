# cookbooks

<br/>
<br/>

The idea of this project stemmed from my hobby of cooking exotic recipes. I try new recipes, practice them a few times but generally don't write them and then learn and practice some other recipe. <br/> It feels great if I can add all the recipes in one place along with a photo, more like a digital cookbook.<br/> This project also implements google oauth as authentication procedure.
